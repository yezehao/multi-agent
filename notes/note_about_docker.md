## Docker
### PULL IMAGE
When using the docker, the image should be pulled from the website of docker, the official website would give a command like `docker pull <name of image>` . For example, I pull a ros melodic desktop full here, my command would be `docker pull osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full`. 

### RUN & EXEC
The image can be run by the following command: `docker run -t -d --name turtlebot osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full`. After running the image, a series of numbers would be given, however, that doesn't matter. The container should be executed by the following command.
```
docker ps -a
```
The result of this command is:
|CONTAINER ID | IMAGE | COMMAND | CREATED | STATUS | PORTS | NAME |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|S7f4c42451437 | osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full | "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦" | 11 seconds ago | Up | 10 seconds | turtlebot |


```
docker exec -it turtlebot /bin/bash

root@7f4c42451437:/#
```

### COMMIT
commit the current container as image after installation and you don't need to worry about the lost of container.
```
docker commit turtlebot turtlebot:2022.07.11
```

### BUILD
The env of docker images can be set up by `Dockerfile`, the Dockerfile need to be built by the command `docker build .`. However, the name of the docker image is `<none>`, in hence, it is necessary to add a tag to the docker image. The first tag (the number of tags is unlimited), which is added to the docker image without name, would become the name of the docker file. The Dockerfile can be built by the following command:
```
docker build -t multi-agent .
```
The docker image called `multi-agent` would be built by this command.
