>Hi Zehao,
>
>Some of our team members were just tested positive so won’t be able to make the meeting soon. I would suggest both you and Minghong take a look at “multi-robot application + deep reinforcement learning”. For example, the following are a few recent papers:

>
>https://elib.dlr.de/132180/2/root.pdf
>
>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9677459

>and you could also take a look at some surveys on deep reinforcement learning in robotics applications, such as

>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10462-021-09997-9.pdf
>
>In our lab, we have multiple TurtleBots and a Jakal, so you may be able to team them up for some collaborative tasks. We also have a few drones, but not sure if they can be easily teamed up with ground robots – but you can find out if you like.
>
>Once you read the above papers, and get some ideas on what you want to do, we could meet at DIF for example Tuesday 12nd April in the morning at about 10am.

>Best wishes,
